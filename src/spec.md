# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Valentine reel proposal copy to “❤️ RHUTHUN❤️” on Page 1 and ensure the Page 2 footer text matches the spec exactly.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Page 1 centered title text to exactly: "❤️ RHUTHUN❤️" while keeping the rest of the Page 1 layout and behavior unchanged.
- Ensure Page 2 footer displays exactly: "© 2025 · Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai" as plain text (no dynamic year, no link), and remove any extra footer text on Page 1 not specified in the request.

**User-visible outcome:** Page 1 shows the updated centered title “❤️ RHUTHUN❤️” above the Valentine question and “Yes! 💕” button, and Page 2 shows only the specified plain-text footer line exactly as written.
